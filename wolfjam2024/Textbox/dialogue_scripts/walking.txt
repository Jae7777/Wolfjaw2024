Talos
I guess I meant to say getting used to having a name.
Kiko
Oh.
Kiko
Isn't it nice?
Talos
Hm?
Kiko
Having a name? I've always felt like... like having a name makes things feel more special, you know? Like because it has a name it has an identity and and um a reason to be cherished?
Kiko
Like my gun- my gun's name is Illio, and my carry case is Atlas, and-
Talos

Talos
Sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable, I was just really focused on what you were saying.
Kiko
You mean it...?
Talos
I swear it.
Talos
A name making things special, huh?
Kiko
Yeah...

Kiko
For what?
Talos
For making me special.
