Kiko
Are you okay-?
Talos
Yes! Yes- I- I'm okay.
Kiko
...
Kiko
Are you sure...?
Talos
NO!
Kiko
...
Talos
Oh my god, I- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell, I'm sorry, I-
Talos

Talos
.....
Kiko
Do you... remember Illio?
Talos
Your gun, right?
Kiko
Yeah!
Kiko
Sometimes I want to just- scream at everything. Like there's this terrible feeling in my heart and I hate it because it makes me feel wrong, like *I'm* wrong, and it's not something I can fix.
Kiko
I can fix my gun, I can fix machines, robots, circuits, but this feeling? In my heart? I don't understand it, I can't- I can't *look* at it, and put it back together again.
Talos
...
Kiko
So I talk to Illio.
Kiko
I talk to Illio about everything, and I know he can't hear me and I know he can't respond, but...
Talos
It helps.
Kiko
It helps.
Kiko
...
Kiko
I know it's not the same, but maybe I could be your Illio?
Talos
Kiko...
Talos
...
Talos
That feeling... in your heart. I don't know if I understand. I don't know if I'm allowed to understand.
Kiko
Is it because of your heart?
Talos
You talk about the heart like it has a... a will of its own, like it feels and- and *breathes*. I don't- I *can't*- see my heart as more than flesh trapped in this useless metal shell.
Kiko
...
Talos
I'm sorry, you were trying to make me feel better, too-
Kiko
I can see your heart.
Talos
...sorry?
Kiko
Your heart! It's like you said, trapped in metal, but on the front of your chest.
Talos
Oh, yeah.
Kiko
I can't fix my heart because I can't see it, or feel it- but yours is right there. Isn't that so interesting?
Talos
I...
Kiko
Like I always tell Illio, always trust in Kiko- if she can see it, she can fix it. We can fix your heart!
Talos
(Laughing) I can't believe you.
Kiko
If she can see it, she can fix it!
Talos
(Still laughing) That's enough of that, a child needs sleep! I'm putting the fire out.
Kiko
(Laughing) She can fix it!
Talos
I can't even- I can't even focus on being upset anymore, go to sleep!
Kiko
We fixed it!
Talos
Hah. Good night, Kiko.
Kiko
Good night, Talos.
