# BrokenHearted

## 1. Abstract
BrokenHearted is a side-scrolling action rpg hackathon project for Wolfjam 2024. In the spirit of the theme of “connection”, BrokenHearted has you following a young girl struggling to emotionally connect with and understand others and a weathered old man whose life as a cybernetic has caused him to lose sight of what makes him human. Brought together by the unexpected, they now journey in search of what they’ve lost– and for a chance to make things right.

## 2. How to Run/Play
Simply run the Wolfjam2024.exe in the project folder.
When prompted with an option that says "Don't run", click more info and run anyway.
The controls are in the options tab on the main menu.
The game will take you to a side-scrolling section after the opening scene, which has no win condition and just changes scene after a set time. Please just take this time to try the movement and attacks? It is just a proof of concept.

## 3. Goal(s)
We wanted to create a gameplay experience that allows you to switch dynamically between the two characters in order to problem solve combat encounters given their wildly different combat styles. Obviously... that did not happen. But we were able to get a dialogue system out that helps to paint the narrative that we were aiming for... somewhat.

## 4. Music
There are 4 .ogg audio files in the Assets folder under Sounds. Only two of the songs were implemented in time but all 4 are available for listening. Please do! We're very proud of our composer.
